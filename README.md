# Using-A-Two-Dimensional-Binary-Matrix-To-Determine-Position-By-Marking-With-A-Light-Pointer
This project detects positions on a 2D binary matrix using a light point (e.g., laser pointer). It processes camera input, applies perspective correction, creates a binary grid, and maps the light's position to the matrix. Features include real-time detection, customizable grids, and visualization of the mapped cell.
